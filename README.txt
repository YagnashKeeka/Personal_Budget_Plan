* 1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The personal budget application is an application where a user can state their salary
per month and their monthly occuring expenses. These expenses can include things such 
as their tax, grocery, travel cost, cellphone and other expenses that occur. Other 
expenses may depend on the user, such as purchasing a property, renting and the
purchasing of the vehicle. It would then calcuate the total expenses for the month, 
showing the user how much income is left. The application would then state whether the
user has exceeded their income for the month.

* 2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION LECTURERS FEEDBACK)
I have removed multiple if statements and replaced it with switch statements in order to
display professionalism. Switch statements  improves clarity and reduces the number of times 
the code is repeated. I have added a try {} catch (){} block. The reason for this is that 
if the user has the incorrect input value, then it would be caught by the catch block.
A do while loop has been added, so that if the user inputs an incorrect value it would
ask the user whether they would like to restart the process or end the process. The 
list that has been created is set to manipulated. it sorts and reverses the list.
The new ReadMe file has been adjusted to occupy more relevant information, so that
the end user has a better understanding of what the program is about

Firstly the file needs to be unzipped once downloaded.
To open the application select the the file named [BudgetPlanning_POE_Task2.sln].
Double click the file or press the enter button (if the file is selected) to open up the 
application. The application will open through the visual studio application and the code 
will be brought up through the application.
*
--Too compile the code:
*Click on the [â–¶ BudgetPlanning_POE_Task2] (a button located on top of the visual studio application)

*A command prompt application would open as a new window.
*The user would need to input their gross monthly income
*The user would need to input all their monthly expenses. These consist of tax, groceries, 
 water and lights, travel costs, cellphone and telephone, and other expenses.

*It would display the values in decending order. 
*If during the process of the input, there is an incorrect value entered by the user, it
 would be caught and show that an error hasbeen committed.

* 6. BUGS
There is a small bug at the end of the application. The whole application executes correcting. 
One value is represented as NAN (this occurs when the values are displayed in decending order).
But the calculations of all the expenses, income, vehicle and home loan executes correctly.
That is the only bug present in the application.
